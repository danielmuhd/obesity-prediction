## Agenda 9/1

### Presentation
1. explain data
- give context (see data/summary.md)
- talk about tidying up the data: round off synthetic numbers, converting to factors, randomising order
2. use case
- zielstellung: f√ºr was ist das gut?, wer kann es wie nutzen?
3. explain model
- what model we used and why
- why we used the variables we used
4. explain results
- run through demo on how to use the app
- interpret tree
- make conclusions
5. decide who presents what

### Code

#### refactoring
1. [x] do all tabs, labels, questions and answers make sense? 
- eg: physical activity: "I do not have" doesnt make sense (I don't exercise sounds better), add per week unit
2. [x] what is a better/more accurate name: obesity estimation or bmi level estimation? (change title accordingly)

#### layout
1. [x] is the layout ok? is there anything that would look nicer somewhere else?
2. [x] should the predicted/actual results be encapsulated in its own tab? or is plaintext enough?
3. [x] do we need to add any images?
4. look at other apps and get ideas from there. see: [rstudio shiny gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)

#### content
1. add help text: what is a first time user expected to do?
- input data in general and habits tab
- read off results
- compare results with bmi table
2. instructions for intepreting the tree 

### Results
1. [x] interpret model, does everything make sense? if not, note it down
2. [x] is the plot readable/easily understandable? should we make it prettier? if yes, how?
